          Originally a joint product with Nintendo, Sony released the
          Playstation in 1994.This was the first console in history to ship over
          100 million units under 10 years. First branded by Sony executive Ken
          Kutaragi, the design was meant to be an extension of the "Super
          Famicom" and dubebd the "SNES-CD." When negotiations ended, Sony
          Interactive greenlit the project. The console shipped with
          firsty-party exclusive games like
          <i>Rayman</i>,<i>Crash Bandicoot</i>, and <i>Gran Turismo.</i>

          Still remaining as the best-selling games console selling at 157
          million units, the Playstation 2 was released in March of 2000.
          Improving off the succes of the first Playstation, Sony added a DVD
          player and offered backwards compatibility with Playstation One games.
          The Playstation 2 is often regarded as the console to bring video
          games into the mainstream for many at the time. The console shipped
          with many classic franchises that have since continued to find a place
          in the contemporary gaming marketplace. Games like
          <i>Metal Gear Solid</i>, <i>Ratchet & Clank</i>, <i>Final Fantasy</i>,
          <i>Grand Theft Auto III</i>, and <i>God of War</i> all left their mark
          on the industry.

          One of the more controversial gaming console released, the Playstation
          shipped in March of 2007. A notable leap from the past generation of
          consoles, the PS3's system architecture touted a Cell Processor. While
          the Cell made the Playstation the most powerful console ever invented,
          the complexity of the processor forced many developers to stop making
          games for the console. While software was at a disadvantage at the
          beginning of the console's life cycle, the PS3 still shipped with
          classic games like <i>Uncharted</i>, <i>The Last of Us</i>,
          <i>The Souls Series</i>, <i>Infamous</i>, and <i>Resistance.</i>

          The Playstation was also the first of Sony's consoles to ship with an
          fully developed online-gaming feature. The Playstation Network allowed
          users to buy music and games from an online marketplace. Contrasting
          Xbox Live, the PS3's online features are still entirely free fro all
          users.

          Releasing in November of 2013, the Playstation 4's development was led
          by system arhitect Mark Cerny, a veteran game developer behind
          projects like <i>Marble Madness</i> and <i>Sonic 2.</i>. While the
          technical leap wasn't as vast as the jump from PS2 to PS3, the PS4
          still made notable improvements in the gaming sphere. The PS4
          introduced virtual reality to casual gaming audiences, provided users
          with high dynamic ranging, and added streaming options for gaming. PS
          VR was released to pair with the PS4 in October of 2016 to limited fan
          fare. Software from Playstation still remained a key player in
          Playstation's success leading up to the PS5. Exclusives such as
          <i>Uncharted 4</i>, <i>God of War</i>, <i>Ghost of Tsushima</i>,
          <i>Spider-Man</i>, and <i>Horzion Zero Dawn.</i> As of now, the PS4
          has sold over 113 million units worldwide.

          Sporting the most ostentatious design of all the Playstation consoles,
          the Playsation 5 released in November 2020. Being led once again by
          system architect Mark Cerny, the biggest improvement the PS5 toutes is
          the new solid state drive. With a much faster SSD, loading times in
          the video gaming sphere have been dramatically reduced. Internally,
          the PS5 also includes the first metal cooling in any console as well
          as ray-tracing on reflective objects in game. The PS5 also received
          extensive upgrades to the controller as the console series has since
          ditched the Dualshock series in favor of the new Dualsense controller.
          The new controller come equipped with haptic feedback on the
          controller, a new touchpad, and much more ergonomic style that mimics
          the larger Xbox controller. With console generations lasting roughly
          between 6-7 years, the PS5 has a few years for developers to grow more
          accustomed to the hardware and take advantage of all the PS5 has to
          offer.
